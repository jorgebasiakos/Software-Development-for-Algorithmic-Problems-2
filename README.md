This assignment involves implementing and comparing graph-based nearest neighbor search algorithms in C for d-dimensional vectors using Euclidean distance. Students will implement the GNNS algorithm (using LSH-based k-NN graphs) and the Search-on-Graph algorithm (using MRNG indexing) to find approximate nearest neighbors. The performance of these algorithms will be compared with LSH and Hypercube from the first assignment in terms of search time and approximation accuracy. Results must be documented, discussed, and the code must be well-structured, documented, and managed with Git.
